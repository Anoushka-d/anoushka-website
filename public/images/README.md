# Images Folder

This folder is where you'll add images for your portfolio projects.

## For the learning exercises

Add your project images here with simple names:
- `project-1.jpg` - for your first portfolio project
- `project-2.jpg` - for your second portfolio project  
- `project-3.jpg` - for your third portfolio project
- `hero-photo.jpg` - optional photo for your homepage

## Image tips

- Keep file sizes under 1MB for web performance
- Use `.jpg` for photos, `.png` for graphics with transparency
- Name files without spaces (use hyphens instead)

## File formats that work

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` - Best for photos
- `.png` - Best for graphics, logos, images with transparency
- `.svg` - Best for simple icons and logos (scales perfectly)
- `.webp` - Modern format with great compression 

You can use [Squoosh App](https://squoosh.app) to compress your images and also convert formats.
