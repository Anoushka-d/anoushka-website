# Learning Path

This is a step-by-step guide through building and customizing websites. Each chapter builds on the previous one and takes about 30-45 minutes to complete.

## What you'll build

By the end of these 8 chapters, you'll have a slightly better idea how to work with your own content, custom components, and a portfolio section. More importantly, you'll understand how websites work and feel confident making changes.

## How this works

Each chapter has:
- Step-by-step instructions 
- Checklist so you know when you're done
- Suggestions on ways to customize and make it your own

## The chapters
